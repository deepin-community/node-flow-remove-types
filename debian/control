Description: Removes Flow type annotations from JavaScript files
 Turn your JavaScript with Flow type annotations into standard JavaScript in an
 instant with no configuration and minimal setup.
 .
 Flow provides static type checking to JavaScript which can both help find and
 detect bugs long before code is deployed and can make code easier to read and
 more self-documenting. The Flow tool itself only reads and analyzes code.
 .
 Running code with Flow type annotations requires first removing the
 annotations which are non-standard JavaScript.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
